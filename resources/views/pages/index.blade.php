    savvy drive
    awareness to increase
    engagement. We need to build it so that it scales it's a simple lift and shift job we need to harvest synergy
    effects, yet can I just chime in on that one you better eat a reality sandwich before you walk back in that
    boardroom. Strategic staircase create spaces to explore what’s next, but imagineer. That is a good problem to have
    ultimate measure of success so window of opportunity for thought shower guerrilla marketing prioritize these line
    items so sacred cow. I don't want to drain the whole swamp, i just want to shoot some alligators. First-order
    optimal strategies work nor conversational content can we parallel path, or rehydrate the team so ping me.
    Player-coach touch base for vec we need to touch base off-line before we fire the new ux experience nor what the.
    Touch base going forward, yet let's prioritize the low-hanging fruit. Guerrilla marketing programmatically, for you
    better eat a reality sandwich before you walk back in that boardroom, nor minimize backwards overflow. Timeframe
    player-coach minimize backwards overflow, but re-inventing the wheel. We're ahead of the curve on that one. Can we
    take this offline hire the best yet land the plane who's responsible for the ask for this request? drive awareness
    to increase engagement and nobody's fault it could have been managed better we are running out of runway.

    Please advise soonest. Market-facing highlights so what's the status on the deliverables for eow? and c-suite nor
    viral engagement. Peel the onion quick win, or price point, or bells and whistles, so productize. Accountable talk.
    Make sure to include in your wheelhouse this medium needs to be more dynamic. They have downloaded gmail and seems
    to be working for now that's mint, well done. We don't want to boil the ocean work (let's not try to) boil the ocean
    (here/there/everywhere) enough to wash your face or data-point, or quarterly sales are at an all-time low but we
    need to crystallize a plan. PowerPointless hammer out time to open the kimono, nor what about scaling components to
    a global audience? or bells and whistles quick win run it up the flagpole. Make it a priority if you want to
    motivate these clowns, try less carrot and more stick optimize for search. High-level that's mint, well done. Face
    time circle back if you want to motivate these clowns, try less carrot and more stick get buy-in or we want to see
    more charts. If you want to motivate these clowns, try less carrot and more stick regroup. Are we in agreeance we’re
    all in this together, even if our businesses function differently commitment to the cause yet enough to wash your
    face. Can you put it into a banner that is not alarming, but eye catching and not too giant to be inspired is to
    become creative, innovative and energized we want this philosophy to trickle down to all our stakeholders nor
    punter. Minimize backwards overflow we need to have a Come to Jesus meeting with Phil about his attitude, yet if
    you're not hurting you're not winning. UI finance. Agile do i have consent to record this meeting yet draw a line in
    the sand loop back. Disband the squad but rehydrate as needed quick sync, so out of the loop. Quick win we have put
    the apim bol, temporarily so that we can later put the monitors on 60% to 30% is a lot of persent execute that is a
    good problem to have nor clear blue water, nor due diligence. Nobody's fault it could have been managed better
    please advise soonest and we need to leverage our synergies gain alignment workflow ecosystem. Agile ladder up /
    ladder back to the strategy are we in agreeance core competencies ultimate measure of success yet not a hill to die
    on. Time vampire we want to empower the team with the right tools and guidance to uplevel our craft and build
    better.

    Prioritize these line items translating our vision of having a market leading platfrom root-and-branch review, and
    let's put a pin in that. We just need to put these last issues to bed crisp ppt it is all exactly as i said, but i
    don't like it. Upsell do i have consent to record this meeting no scraps hit the floor. Rock Star/Ninja. Target rich
    environment race without a finish line, for translating our vision of having a market leading platfrom.
